            <h2>About This Project</h2>
            <p>The glaciated part of the High Mountain Asia region has captured scientists' attention for the last three decades as it hosts the largest glacier concentration outside the polar regions. Intense glaciers retreat and the constantly changing picture in this region are caused by global warming, which occurs worldwide in response to increasing human activity and the acceleration of complex environmental changes.
                A large population lives downstream by rivers which are primarily fed by glaciers. On one hand, such a location substantially contributes to the water supply. On the other hand, it poses a huge threat to human lives due to potential glacial hazard activization.</p>
                <p>One of the high-risk processes associated with glaciers is glacier avalanches. Starts as a large breakout of ice masses from a steep or hanging glacier, an ice avalanche may travel from the first to even tens of kilometers down the valleys, especially in combination with rock falls or snow avalanches. This process could have indirect effects such as blocking river valleys or causing a moraine-dammed glacial lake breakout, leading to serious secondary hazard risks. According to various scientific studies, ice avalanches are often manifest as the first stage of multi-stage catastrophes.</p>

            <h2>Ice Avalanches and Cascading Effect</h2>
            <p>Cascading disasters refer to a primary natural disaster triggering secondary events, which can lead to a series of emergencies. In the context of glaciers, the process often begins with a triggering event such as an earthquake or a volcanic eruption beneath the ice, a rapid melt, or the buildup of water in glacial lakes, which is known as a jökulhlaup. When a glacier destabilizes, it can result in several cascading events:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ice Avalanche: Large masses of ice may break away from the glacier and tumble down the slope, gathering rock and debris, and increasing in mass and destructive power.</li>
                <li>Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF): The sudden release of water from a glacier or a moraine-dammed lake can cause catastrophic flooding downstream, destroying infrastructure and settlements.</li>
                <li>Landslide and Debris Flows: The material displaced by an ice avalanche can destabilize the surrounding terrain, leading to landslides or debris flows that can further alter the landscape and river courses.</li>
                <li>Flooding: The sudden input of water from glacier melt or ice-dammed lakes can lead to riverine flooding, which may be compounded by blocked rivers due to debris or landslides.</li>
                <li>Infrastructure Failure: The initial disaster can lead to a domino effect, such as the failure of dams or bridges, which in turn causes additional flooding and destruction.</li>
                <li>Habitat Destruction and Long-Term Ecological Impact: Beyond immediate human casualties and property loss, these events can cause long-term ecological damage, changing landscapes, and disrupting ecosystems.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The Huascarán disaster refers to the catastrophic events. The 1962 and 1970 events originating from Glaciar 511 on the Nevados Huascarán, the highest peak of which is at 6768 m above sea level in the Peruvian Andes, were particularly severe. On 10 January 1962, an ice avalanche took place with an estimated starting volume of 10 million cubic meters; the avalanche traveled down 16 km and destroyed the city of Ranrahirca, where 4000 people died. On 31 May 1970, the most catastrophic rock-ice avalanche known in history was triggered at 3:23 p.m. by a strong earthquake with a magnitude of 7.7. The avalanche originated from a partially overhanging cliff at 5400 to 6500 m above sea level, where the fractured granite rock of the peak was covered by a 30 metre thick glacier. The avalanche, which had an estimated volume of 50 to 100 million m3, traveled 16 km to Rio Santa down a vertical drop of 4 km. Along its path, the avalanche overrode a hill in the downstream area and completely destroyed the city of Yungay, claiming about 18000 lives.</p>
            <p>The Kolka–Karmadon rock-ice slide (model visualization on the left) occurred on the northern slope of the Mount Kazbek massif in North Ossetia–Alania (Central Caucasus, Russia) on 20 September 2002, following a partial collapse of the Kolka Glacier. an immense volume of material, estimated between 130 to 140 million cubic meters, was transported during the Karmadon disaster, of which approximately 110 million cubic meters consisted of ice and debris that accumulated in the Karmadon depression. The resulting avalanche and mudflow killed more than 120 people, including a film crew of 27 people, among them Russian actor and director Sergei Bodrov Jr.</p>
            <p>The Chamoli disaster, which occurred in February 2021 in the Indian state of Uttarakhand, was a devastating event where a part of the Nanda Devi glacier broke off, triggering an avalanche and flash flooding. This flood rushed down the Rishiganga and Dhauliganga river valleys, destroying two hydroelectric stations and leaving over 200 people missing or dead. The disaster brought to light the acute vulnerability of the Himalayan region to climate change and the risks associated with infrastructure development in such fragile ecological zones.            </p>
